        <h1>About</h1>
        
        <p>
            I'm an AI engineer, product designer, and strategist who specializes in building AI-first software 
            systems for both regulated and unregulated markets. My work spans healthcare, real estate, and 
            productivity tools, where I focus on creating practical, scalable, and maintainable solutions 
            that bridge technical innovation with user-centered design.
        </p>

        <p>
            My approach combines pragmatism with technical depthâ€”I believe in building quick, working prototypes 
            that can validate ideas fast, then refining them into robust systems. I'm particularly passionate 
            about agentic workflows, RAG systems, multimodal retrieval, and LLM-integrated architectures that 
            go beyond traditional monolithic applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I'm not building software, I teach AI adoption to senior professionals and enterprise teams, 
            helping organizations navigate the practical challenges of implementing AI systems in complex 
            regulatory environments. I advocate for human-in-the-loop approaches that maintain user agency 
            while leveraging AI capabilities to enhance productivity and decision-making.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Focus</h2>
        <p>
            I work primarily with modern web technologies including Next.js, React, TypeScript, and various 
            database solutions like PostgreSQL and Supabase. My projects often involve integrating AI/ML 
            capabilities, building responsive user interfaces, and creating scalable backend systems that 
            can handle complex workflows and real-time collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>
            I prefer minimal dependencies and lean solutions over heavy frameworks, always keeping ownership 
            of core logic while strategically using no-code/low-code tools where they add value without 
            compromising flexibility.
        </p>
