never center aligned, always left.

the portfolio should have a header with a navigation bar, a footer and a main content area.

the main content area on home page has a grid of placehoder images and project titles

each project has a detailed page on a separate html file. structure: title, intro, one screenshot, tech stack

back button to go back to the home page.

## content and structure
. Is 2-3 sentences as requested
  2. Includes specific tech stacks (Next.js, Vite, PostgreSQL, 
  Supabase, TypeScript, etc.)
  3. Shows different types of projects that would be relevant for an 
  AI engineer and product designer portfolio
  4. Aligns with the user's background in regulated markets 
  (healthcare, real estate) and productivity tools

  The projects cover:
  - AI-powered productivity (Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase)
  - Real estate analytics (Vite, React, PostgreSQL) 
  - Healthcare compliance (Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL)
  - E-commerce SaaS (Vite, TypeScript, Supabase)
  - Regulatory compliance (Next.js, PostgreSQL)

  This gives a good variety of tech stacks and project types that 
  would demonstrate the breadth of skills for an AI engineer working 
  in various regulated and unregulated markets.
