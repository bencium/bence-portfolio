squeeze this concept into the hero section: 

oncept: “Open Bays” (live shopfloor for agentic work)
We don’t sell slides. We open the garage door.

Platform: Syndicate Open Bays

Public shopfloor: a live wall of projects (“bays”) with sanitized screenshots, short clips, demo links, tech stack tags, and current status lights.
Columns: Intake → Diagnose → Build → Road-test → Ship → Telemetry.

Map, not menu: every bay shows 3 mini-maps:

Value Map (job-to-be-done + KPI)

System Map (agent graph + data flow)

Safety Map (guardrails, approvals, audit trail)

Agentic rapid apps only: small, composable services (FastAPI/React/TS/Python/Postgres + lightweight agent runtime).
No Zapier/Salesforce sprawl. No BS. Ship working software.

Traceable by default: show redacted test fixtures, run logs, and pass/fail checks so clients see how it works, not just the result.

Demo garden: each bay auto-publishes a clickable demo (or loom-style micro-video) as it evolves.

Process (what clients experience)

Diagnose (1–2 days): crisp problem + KPI, constraints, data access.

Blueprint (1 week): the three maps + go/no-go + price band.

Build in the Bay: daily visible progress, short demos, PR links.

Road-test: scenario fixtures, approval gates, kill-switches.

Ship + Telemetry: deploy, measure, tune. Continuous tiny wins.

Why it’s different

Radical transparency (live bays) instead of testimonials.

Opinionated stack (agentic rapid apps) instead of tool soup.

Design + engineering fused: the map is the product spec.

draft hero section: Hero title:
We build agentic apps in the open.

Subhead:
Live bays, real progress, zero fluff. Design clarity + engineering discipline. No tool sprawl—just small, fast systems that ship and improve.

Micro-philosophy (one-liner under the fold):
Map the value, make it observable, keep it simple, ship weekly.
